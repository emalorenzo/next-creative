warning - [analysis] /turbopack/crates/turbopack-tests/tests/execution/webpack/side-effects/type-reexports/input/empty.js  unexpected export *
  
  export * used with module [project]/turbopack/crates/turbopack-tests/tests/execution/webpack/side-effects/type-reexports/input/empty.js [test] (ecmascript) which has no exports
  Typescript only: Did you want to export only types with `export type * from "..."`?
  Note: Using `export type` is more efficient than `export *` as it won't emit any runtime code.
