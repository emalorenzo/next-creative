## What this notice means

The development overlay shows that your installed version of Next.js is not the latest available. During development, Next.js checks the [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next) and compares your installed version against the latest release. If a newer version is available, Next.js displays a notice in the overlay.

Newer versions contain bug fixes and improved error tracing capabilities. Upgrade before investigating further.

Upgrading Next.js won't fix errors that originate in your own code or third-party libraries. However, newer versions often provide better error messages and stack traces that can help you identify the root cause.

If upgrading does not resolve your issue, search [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions) to see if others have encountered the same problem. If you cannot find a match, consider creating a new discussion with details about your error.

If you believe the issue is a bug in Next.js and you have a minimal, shareable reproduction repository, [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/new/choose).

> **Good to know:** A reproduction repository is required when opening an issue. Issues without one are automatically closed.

## Staleness levels

- **Stale (patch or minor):** A newer stable release is available with bug fixes or new features.
- **Stale (prerelease):** You are on a canary release and a newer canary is available. Canary versions are published frequently, so this is expected.
- **Outdated (major):** Your installed version is behind by a major version. Upgrading is recommended to get security fixes and new features.

## Upgrading

Latest stable version:

![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/next/latest?label=next@latest&color=black)

To upgrade to the latest stable release:

```bash package="npm"
npm i next@latest
```

```bash package="yarn"
yarn add next@latest
```

```bash package="pnpm"
pnpm add next@latest
```

```bash package="bun"
bun add next@latest
```

To upgrade to the latest canary release:

```bash package="npm"
npm i next@canary
```

```bash package="yarn"
yarn add next@canary
```

```bash package="pnpm"
pnpm add next@canary
```

```bash package="bun"
bun add next@canary
```

If you are coming from an older major version, check out the [upgrade guides](/docs/app/guides/upgrading).
